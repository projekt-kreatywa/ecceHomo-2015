ecceHomo 2015 edition is an exploration of shapes. call it a quasi-automatic workflow for graphical mass-exploration. 

the purpose of it all is matching vector shapes (.svg format) with text (.md or .json files for the start) that include short stories and dialogs.

think of it as joyce's epiphanies 21 century flavour with networking, social web, open source, social coding (github flavour) and the lot.

from the start through to the end it's all about story telling and stories in separate [repos on github](https://github.com/projekt-kreatywa) are available to view, fork, clone, commit changes, create a pull request from anyone including you.

the point is to add your mods but remember that by adding your modifications you become part of the story. 

that's the deal.

call it "meta-interactive" story telling.
